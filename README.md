# UFC-Stats

This project is connected to the sportsdataio api. Which is a free and public api. This project can show information about the fighters, upcoming fights, fight results, and more. 

Some of the information is scrambled meaning the developers of the api require a premium subscription to access all data. So I will be only showing the information that is not scrambled since there is no way that I am paying for that subscription because I am very broke right now.
